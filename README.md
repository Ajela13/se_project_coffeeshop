### 3. Interactive Elements

We believe in making the user experience as engaging as possible through interactive elements and features. In future updates, you can expect:

- Interactive widgets that allow users to interact with content in real-time.
- Gamification elements such as rewards and challenges to incentivize user engagement and participation.

### 2. Improved Social Media Widgets

We recognize the importance of making it easy for users to follow on Instagram and other social media platforms. In future updates, you can expect:

- Prominent follow buttons for Instagram on every page of our website, making it effortless for users to click and follow directly from any page.
- Implementation of interactive Instagram widgets that display the latest posts, stories, and highlights, giving users a glimpse into Instagram content and encouraging them to follow for more.
